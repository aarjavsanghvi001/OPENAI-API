The files below progress from basics to advanced showing ways to use OPENAI platform:

1. OPENAI - Prompting.ipynb
  This file should be used to learn how to setup the OPENAI API and learn how to iterate over the prompts to get better results.
  PS: A couple of code chunks show error as I hate exhauseted my rate limits. This would not pose to be a problem incase someone is using the paid version on gpt.

2. OPENAI - Chatbot System
  This file is for intermediate users. I've developed an automated chatbot that helps customers know more about the products being sold by an electronics store using only prompts. 

3. OPENAI - Ordering Automation System
  This file is for intermediate users. I've developed an bot that takes order from a customer acting as an employee at a pizzeria. It is precise, clear and polite. 
  PS: If someone wants to build on top of this system, then they can use a text to speech AI and deploy a full blown automated OrderBot.

4. OPENAI - Chat with Document
  Rhis file is for advanced users. This project does exactly what the ChatGPT Plus does. The only caveat is that this uses gpt-3.5-turbo. However, companies can use this script to deploy this script to allow their customers/employees to upload documents ask questions to the model.
  PS: The future iteration of this project would be to create a GUI that makes it easier for users to iteract with the script.
